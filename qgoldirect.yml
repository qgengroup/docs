    This API enables QGen clients to integrate their systems with QGen to access our services.
    It is written supporting the openAPI standards and all data returned is in JSON format. 
    
    Requests should be directed to the appropriate API URL 
    - Staging: https://qgenonlinestaging.com/integration-api/
    - Production: TBD
    
    All API requests must be made over HTTPS as HTTP is not supported. 
    See the authentication section for information on correctly authenticating calls 
    to the QGen Direct API.
    For any queries please contact: support@qgengroup.com
    
    # Generate API Key
    
    Login to qgenonline.com with a user that has credentials to generate API keys. In the **Settings** menu 
    you will find the **Generate API key** sub menu. Click on it and fill in the form.
    For security reason, we recommend you specify the IP address of your client accessing ourt API. If left 
    empty, IP whitelisting is disabled, meaning that all IPs can access the API.
    
    # How to use the API explorer
    
    This page allows you to test the APIs directly without any coding. It's great to test some examples and
    make sure your keys are woring and the servers are connected. Start bt clicking gthe 
    **Try it out** button in the Login section. This will allow you to edit the body paramters with your
    clientID and secret Key as generated from QGen Online page.
    
    From the response, cut the access_token value (whatever is inside the qutations) and paste it in the 
    **value** field shown when you press the **Authorize** button shown here.
    
    You can then press the **Try it now** buttons on the other endpoints, edit the values of the fields in
    the *Body*  and press **Execute**

        You should have already generated an access key pair via QGen Online Dev tools section.
        If not, Login to QGen Online using your admin user credentials, and access the Dev tools 
        to generate an API key. You can generate multiple keys for both
        the staging or production environments. Multiple keys are uniquely
        identified by a unique key identifier called ClientID.
        This 'Login' endpoint converts your clientID/secretkey pair, if validated, into
        a JWT session token to use during your other API calls. You can call this more than one 
        time during a session to make sure it does not expire. So check the expiry time 
        provided with the token in the response and make sure to generate a new token before the time is up. 
        Parameters required:
        - clientID
        - apikey
